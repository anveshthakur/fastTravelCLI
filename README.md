<h3>CD to a directory super fast</h4>

Typing out a long directory path can be a bit painful. Most tools that solve this problem give you less to type but still involve additional steps afterwards. Instead of tracking frequently visited directories, using a fuzzy search, or even a ML model to improve the cd experience, fastTravelCLI allows you to directly save a destination as a key-value pair, then you can fast travel to that location by just using the key you set. 
<br></br>
fastTravelCLI takes an experience like this: 
```
cd $(find * -type d | fzf)
```
```
